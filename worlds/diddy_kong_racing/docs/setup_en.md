# Setup Guide For Diddy Kong Racing Archipelago

## Important
As we are using BizHawk, this guide is only applicable to Windows and Linux systems.

## Required Software/Files
-   BizHawk:  [BizHawk Releases from TASVideos](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory)
    -   Only version 2.10 is supported.
    -   Detailed installation instructions for BizHawk can be found at the above link.
    -   Windows users must run the prereq installer first, which can also be found at the above link.
-   Grab the latest release from https://github.com/zakwiz/DiddyKongRacingAP
-   A Diddy Kong Racing v1.0 ROM (USA ONLY).

## Configuring BizHawk
Once BizHawk has been installed, open EmuHawk and change the following settings:

-   Under Config > Customize, check the "Run in background" and "Accept background input" boxes. This will allow you to continue playing in the background, even if another window is selected.
-   Under Config > Hotkeys, many hotkeys are listed, with many bound to common keys on the keyboard. You will likely want to disable most of these, which you can do quickly using  `Esc`.
-   If playing with a controller, when you bind controls, disable "P1 A Up", "P1 A Down", "P1 A Left", and "P1 A Right" as these interfere with aiming if bound. Set directional input using the Analog tab instead.
-   Under N64 enable "Use Expansion Slot". (The N64 menu only appears after loading a ROM.)

It is strongly recommended to associate N64 rom extensions (*.n64, *.z64) to the EmuHawk we've just installed. To do so, we simply have to search any N64 rom we happened to own, right click and select "Open withâ€¦", unfold the list that appears and select the bottom option "Look for another application", then browse to the BizHawk folder and select EmuHawk.exe.

## How To Install - Server Side
Double-click `diddy_kong_racing.apworld` to install it into the `custom_worlds` folder of your Archipelago install.

## How To Install - Client Side
- Double-click `diddy_kong_racing.apworld` to install it into the `custom_worlds` folder of your Archipelago install.
- Copy `data/lua/connector_diddy_kong_racing.lua` into the `lua` folder in your existing Archipelago folder (`data/lua`).
- Run the Archipelago launcher and select Diddy Kong Racing Client.
- The client will prompt you to select your ROM so it can be patched.
- Connect the Archipelago Client with the server.
- Open Bizhawk (version 2.10 only) and open your patched Diddy Kong Racing ROM (it should be in the top-level folder of your Archipelago install).
- Run the `connector_diddy_kong_racing.lua` script (drag and drop it into Bizhawk).

## Connect To The Multiserver
To connect the client to the multiserver, simply put `<address>:<port>` in the textfield on top and press `connect` (if the server uses password, then it will prompt after connection).
