# SETUP GUIDE FOR DIDDY KONG RACING ARCHIPELAGO

## Important

As we are using BizHawk, this guide is only applicable to Windows and Linux systems.

## Required Software/Files

-   BizHawk:  [BizHawk Releases from TASVideos](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory)
    -   Version 2.9.1 and later are supported.
    -   Detailed installation instructions for BizHawk can be found at the above link.
    -   Windows users must run the prereq installer first, which can also be found at the above link.
-   Grab the latest release from https://github.com/zakwiz/DiddyKongRacingAP
-   A Diddy Kong Racing v1.0 ROM (USA ONLY).

## Configuring BizHawk

Once BizHawk has been installed, open EmuHawk and change the following settings:

-   Under Config > Customize, check the "Run in background" and "Accept background input" boxes. This will allow you to continue playing in the background, even if another window is selected.
-   Under Config > Hotkeys, many hotkeys are listed, with many bound to common keys on the keyboard. You will likely want to disable most of these, which you can do quickly using  `Esc`.
-   If playing with a controller, when you bind controls, disable "P1 A Up", "P1 A Down", "P1 A Left", and "P1 A Right" as these interfere with aiming if bound. Set directional input using the Analog tab instead.
-   Under N64 enable "Use Expansion Slot". (The N64 menu only appears after loading a ROM.)

It is strongly recommended to associate N64 rom extensions (*.n64, *.z64) to the EmuHawk we've just installed. To do so, we simply have to search any N64 rom we happened to own, right click and select "Open withâ€¦", unfold the list that appears and select the bottom option "Look for another application", then browse to the BizHawk folder and select EmuHawk.exe.
