# Diddy Kong Racing

## Where is the settings page?
The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
Randomizes items, allows starting with balloons and amulet pieces, and allows skipping trophy races.

## What items and locations get shuffled?
- Golden balloons
- Keys
- Wizpig amulet pieces
- T.T. amulet pieces

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
When the player receives an item, it will be displayed on the client.

## Unique local commands
The following commands are available when using the Diddy Kong Racing Client to play with Archipelago:
- `/n64` Check N64 Connection State

## Known quirks
- Amulet cutscenes show you having 1 more piece than you actually have, unless the item in that location was vanilla.
- If you beat the first boss race in a region before completing all the race 1's for that region, after completing a race 1, if you don't have enough balloons to enter race 2, you will be stuck inside the locked door. To get around this, you can go back into the race, pause, and return to lobby.
- If you find all 8 regional balloons for a region before winning first boss race of that region, you will skip to the second boss race (this is to avoid a glitch).
- Collected keys reappear when reloading a race.
